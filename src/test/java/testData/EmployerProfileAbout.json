    "employerDescription":"Cacia's has been a South Philadelphia tradition for over 60 years. Cacia's is still family owned and operated, (we are into the 4th generation), and we have one of the last brick oven bakeries left in Philadelphia. You will always find a member of the Cacia family at each location, just ask for a Cacia.",
    "newEmployerDescription":"Another piece of the great bakery pizza/tomato pie puzzle, Cacia's has been a south Philly staple for over 50 years, a tiny brick-oven bakery storefront - no chairs or tables and room for maybe 5 people, usually full - that sells room-temperature square sheet pan pizza along with bread, rolls, and stromboli. Cacia's pizza is different from most in that their crust is much thinner than the sicilian-and-then-some. Philadelphia tomato pie standard, maybe the thinnest in the city that still falls under the category of authentic bakery pizza.",
